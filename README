A set of MATLAB programs for generating LAMMPS input files for
molecular dynamics simulation of alkanethiol-gold nanoparticle
superlattice. LAMMPS is a fast, free classical molecular dynamics
code under GPL license. See http://lammps.sandia.gov/ for more
information.

The directory "AllAtomModel" contains code for all-atom representation
of alkanethiol molecules using Allinger et al's MM3 potential.

The directory "UnitedAtomModel" contains code for coarse-grained
representation of alkanethiol molecules using united-atom model.

For details, please refer to the "README" files within respective
directories.

A set of MATLAB programs for generating LAMMPS input files for
molecular dynamics simulation of alkanethiol-gold nanoparticle
superlattice. LAMMPS is a fast, free classical molecular dynamics
code under GPL license. See http://lammps.sandia.gov/ for more
information.

The directory "SingleNanoParticle" contains the MATLAB code for
generating LAMMPS data file for molecular dynamics simulation of a
single alkanethiol-gold nanoparticle. The alkanethiol molecules are
coarse-grained using united-atom model. A LAMMPS input file
"lammps.input" is provided, which specifies the force field
parameters. The presence of other files is explained by the
annotations within the MATLAB code.

The directory "Superlattice" contains the MATLAB code for generating
LAMMPS data file for molecular dynamics simulation gold nanoparticle
superlattice with different orientations.

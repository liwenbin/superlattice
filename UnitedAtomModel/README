The directory "SingleNanoParticle" contains the MATLAB code for
generating LAMMPS data file for molecular dynamics simulation of a
single alkanethiol-gold nanoparticle. The alkanethiol molecules are
coarse-grained using united-atom model. A LAMMPS input file
"lammps.input" is provided, which specifies the force field
parameters. The presence of other files are explained by the
annotations within the MATLAB code.

The directory "Superlattice" contains the MATLAB code for generating
LAMMPS data file for molecular dynamics simulation gold nanoparticle
superlattice with different orientations.

LAMMPS is an open-source classical molecular dynamics code under GPL
license. See also http://lammps.sandia.gov/ for more information.

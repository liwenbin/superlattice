The directory "SingleNanoParticle" contains the MATLAB code for
generating LAMMPS data file for all-atom simulation of a single
alkanethiol-gold nanoparticle. The all-atom simulation uses Allinger
et al's MM3 force field [Ref: N. L. Allinger, Y. H. Yuh and J.-H. Lii,
"Molecular Mechanics. The MM3 Force Field for Hydrocarbons. 1",
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111, 8551-8566 (1989)]. Within the directory, a
LAMMPS input file "lammps.input" is also provided, which specifies the
force field parameters. The presence of other files is explained by
the annotations within the MATLAB code.

The directory "Superlattice" contains the MATLAB code for generating
LAMMPS data file for all-atom simulation of gold nanoparticle
superlattice with different orientations. A LAMMPS input file
"lammps.input" is also provided.

The directory "LAMMPS" contains the LAMMPS code we used to perform
MM3 all-atom simulation. We provide these codes because the LAMMPS
"class2" angle and dihedral styles have been slightly changed for MM3
simulation. These changes include:

(1) In LAMMPS class2 angle potential:

http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/angle_class2.html

We change Ea = K2*(theta - theta0)^2 + K3*(theta - theta0)^3 +
               K4*(theta - theta0)^4
   to     Ea = K2*(theta - theta0)^2 + K3*(theta - theta0)^3 +
               K4*(theta - theta0)^4 + K5*(theta - theta0)^5 +
               K6*(theta - theta0)^6
Namely, we add the fifth and sixth order angle terms.


(2) In LAMMPS class2 dihedral potential:

http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/dihedral_class2.html

We change "Embt" (middle-bond-torsion term) from
Embt = (r_{jk} - r_{2})[A1*cos(phi) + A2*cos(2phi)
       + A3*cos(3phi)

to

Embt = (r_{jk} - r_{2})[A1*cos(phi) + A2*cos(2phi)
       + A3*(1+cos(3phi))

Namely, "cos(3phi)" is replaced by "1+cos(3phi)".


We also change "Eaat" (angle-angle-torsion term) from
Eaat = M*(theta_{ijk} - theta1)(theta_{jkl} - theta2)*cos(phi)

to 

Eaat = M*(theta_{ijk} - theta1)(theta_{jkl} - theta2)

Namely, we delete the "cos(phi)" term.

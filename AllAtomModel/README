The directory "SingleNanoParticle" contains
the MATLAB code for generating LAMMPS data
file for all-atom simulation of a single
alkanethiol-gold nanoparticle, using Allinger
et al's MM3 force field. A LAMMPS input file
"lammps.input" is also provided.

The directory "Superlattice" contains
the MATLAB code for generating LAMMPS data
file for all-atom simulation of gold nanoparticle
superlattice with different orientation. A LAMMPS
input file "lammps.input" is also provided.

The directory "LAMMPS_CodeChange_MM3" contains
the LAMMPS codes we used to perform MM3 all-atom
simulation. We provide the codes here because
the LAMMPS "class2" angle and dihedral styles
have been slightly changed for MM3 simulation.
The force field changes are annotated in the
file "LAMMPS_Classs2_ForceFieldChange.pdf"
within the directory.

LAMMPS is open-source software under GPL license.
The license file is contained within the directory
"LAMMPS_CodeChange_MM3".
